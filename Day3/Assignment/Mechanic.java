/* Create a class Vehicle which will have 3 methods and some properties along with 2 constructors.
details -- will show details of vehicle
drive -- will be implemented later
inspect -- will be implemented later
Create 2 subclasses called as Bike and Car will extend Vehicle and will implement all the above given methods
Create a main class called Mechanic also which will be used to test all Vehicles*/
